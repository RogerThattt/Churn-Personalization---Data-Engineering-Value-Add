# Churn-Personalization---Data-Engineering-Value-Add

Here's a **telecom industry use case** showing how applying the **data engineering principle** â€” *"Understand Your Data Workload Characteristics"* â€” translates into **tangible business benefits**, particularly using **Databricks**.

---

## **Use Case: Real-Time Network Fault Detection and Root Cause Analysis**

### **Business Goal**

Quickly identify and resolve network faults to minimize downtime and improve customer experience (QoE), especially for high-value customers (enterprise or 5G subscribers).

---

## **Challenge Without Understanding Data Characteristics**

### **Before Optimization**

* Raw telemetry (logs, SNMP traps, syslogs, etc.) from **50K+ network devices** dumped unpartitioned into cloud storage (e.g., S3).
* Daily ingest volume: **2 TB/day**
* Spark jobs on Databricks scanning massive unpartitioned tables
* Schemas not aligned to access patterns (wide tables with many NULLs, poor column pruning)
* Read latency for fault analysis: **15â€“30 minutes**
* Engineering cost: high compute consumption with long job runtimes

### ðŸ”´ *Business Impact*:

* Delayed fault resolution
* SLA breaches for enterprise clients
* Escalating infrastructure costs

## **Data Engineering Principle Applied on Databricks**

### âœ… After Optimization (Following the Principle)

#### **Workload Understanding**

* **Volume**: 2 TB/day, growing 20% YoY
* **Velocity**: Real-time logs arriving every few seconds
* **Variety**: SNMP, syslogs, custom JSON logs
* **Veracity**: Incomplete or duplicate logs from devices under load

#### **Engineering Improvements**

| Area                    | Optimization                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Partitioning**        | Partitioned logs by `date`, `region`, and `device_type` using Delta Lake               |
| **Schema Design**       | Switched from raw JSON blobs to **Delta Lake + Parquet**, enforced schema validation   |
| **Read/Write Patterns** | Used **Z-Ordering on timestamp + severity** to speed up most common queries            |
| **Data Cleaning**       | Integrated `expectations` with Delta Live Tables to handle bad/missing data gracefully |

## **Resulting Business Benefits**

| Metric                            | Before   | After              |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Mean fault detection time         | 25 min   | **<5 min**         |
| Query cost (Databricks DBU usage) | High     | **40% lower**      |
| SLA violations (per quarter)      | 37       | **<5**             |
| Customer support escalations      | Frequent | **Reduced by 60%** |

### ðŸ’¡ **Additional Gains**

* More accurate **root cause ML models** due to better data quality and schema consistency.
* Platform team was able to scale operations with **fewer cluster nodes**, thanks to reduced scan and compute overhead.
